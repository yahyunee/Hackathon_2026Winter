# What is a Hackathon?

## 1-Minute Summary for Beginners

> **"A Research Time Machine: Complete 3 months of research in 3 nights and 4 days"**

A **Hackathon** is a combination of "Hacking" and "Marathon." Here, hacking doesn't mean cybercrime - it means **"the joy of efficiently and technically diving into difficult problems to solve them."**

Think of it like an **Iron Chef competition**:

- **Regular Research:** You go shopping for ingredients, wash them, prepare them, and spend months pondering recipes.
- **Hackathon:** You bring perfectly prepared **premium ingredients (data)** and **recipes (hypotheses)**, and the best chefs (researchers) focus insanely on cooking (coding/experiments) for 3 nights and 4 days in an isolated space to create unprecedented results.

We block out daily distractions (emails, administrative work) and focus 100% on **research and development**. By compressing processes that would normally drag on, we aim to produce **tangible outcomes (models, code, paper drafts)** that would be impossible alone in a short time.

## Why is Preparation Critical?

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### For a 40-person, 5-lab Hackathon Success

This hackathon isn't a small study group - it's a large-scale project with 40 participants from 5 labs. Coming empty-handed with a "let's figure it out there" attitude will result in 100% failure. Especially with Neuro-AI data that is massive and requires long training times - starting preparation on-site means you'll spend all 3 nights and 4 days just transferring data.

For a successful hackathon, we **strongly request completion of 3 essential preparations before departure**.

</div>

### ✅ Essential Preparation 1: Research Topic and Hypothesis Definition

The first day of the hackathon should be when you run your first code, not when you decide on a topic. Prepare a "testable hypothesis," not just a vague idea.

- **Bad:** "I want to analyze EEG data with deep learning." (too abstract)
- **Good:** "To verify Emotion Contextualized Perception, develop a new Transformer model on the ABCD dataset and produce benchmarking scores within 3 days." (specific)
- **Action Item:** Each team must complete a 1-page proposal with **[research goal, expected outcomes, model structure]** before the kickoff meeting.

### ✅ Essential Preparation 2: Data Curation and Preprocessing [Most Important]

Neuro-AI data (fMRI, EEG, ECoG, ABCD Dataset, etc.) is massive and complex. You cannot afford to waste two days downloading 26TB of data or removing noise in the on-site internet environment.

- **Data Acquisition:** Finalize the dataset for analysis and obtain access permissions for secure data (ABCD, etc.) in advance.
- **Preprocessing Complete (Model-Ready):** Do NOT process Raw Data on-site. Complete noise removal, format conversion (BIDS, etc.), and dimensionality reduction beforehand, and prepare data in a form **ready for immediate model training (Train_X.npy, etc.)** on external hard drives or cloud storage.
- **Environment Testing:** Test in advance that required libraries, GPU server access, Docker environment, etc., are working properly.

### ✅ Essential Preparation 3: Sufficient Brainstorming and Role Assignment

The on-site is for **execution**, not discussion. To prevent 40 people from wandering aimlessly, each person's position must be clear.

- **Role Definition:** Decide who will do core coding (Core Modeler), who will handle data pipelines (Data Engineer), and who will handle result interpretation and visualization (Analyst).
- **Scenario Check:** Discuss even "If this model doesn't work, what is Plan B?"

## Sample Daily Schedule

| Time | Activity | Expert Tip |
|------|----------|------------|
| **09:00** | Breakfast & Daily Stand-up | "How did last night's training go?" Share briefly and get straight to work. |
| **10:00** | Sprint [Morning Focused Coding] | Your brain is clearest now. Write the hardest code during this time. |
| **13:00** | Lunch | |
| **14:00** | Co-Work [Afternoon Research & Mentoring] | Don't struggle alone - ask the PhD student in the next room. Hackathons are about collective intelligence. |
| **16:00** | Tea Time, Walk, Break [Mandatory] | Take your eyes off the monitor - new solutions emerge. |
| **18:00** | Dinner | |
| **20:00** | Sprint [Late Night Development (Optional)] | Manage your energy wisely. Set long-running model training during this time. |

## Expert Recommendations for Successful Hackathons

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### 1. Tangible Outcomes

"Working hard" doesn't matter. Aim for visible outputs like **"trained model weights," "validated benchmarking design," "working prototype."**

### 2. Collaboration over Competition

The reason 5 labs gathered is for synergy, not competition. Actively absorb other labs' know-how (GPU optimization, data interpretation perspectives) and break down barriers between labs through **Hybrid Parallelism**.

### 3. Documentation (Power of Records)

Brilliant ideas and code from the hackathon will be forgotten when you go home. Record all progress and troubleshooting processes in real-time to preserve them as research assets.

**Only those who are prepared can experience the miracle of 3 nights and 4 days.**
